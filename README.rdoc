This is a functional example for the plugin Ajaxful Rating:

  http://github.com/edgarjs/ajaxful-rating

To run the app (each line is a single command):

  git clone git@github.com:edgarjs/ajaxful-rating_demo_app.git
  sudo rake gems:install
  rake db:migrate
  script/server
  
And thatâ€™s all. Point your browser to http://localhost:3000 and see it works.

Feel free to contribute and add a nice style to this demo app ;)
